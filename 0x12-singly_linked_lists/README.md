Linked lists are a fundamental data structure used to store and manage a collection of elements. Unlike arrays, which store elements in contiguous memory locations, linked lists consist of nodes where each node contains the data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list.

In C, a linked list can be implemented using a structure to define the nodes. The structure typically includes two members: one to hold the data and another to hold the pointer to the next node. Here's an example of a basic linked list node structure:
struct Node {
    int data;           // Data stored in the node
    struct Node* next;  // Pointer to the next node
};

To create a linked list, you need to keep track of the head (first node) of the list. Initially, the head will be set to NULL to indicate an empty list. As you add nodes to the list, you dynamically allocate memory for each node using the malloc function.

Here's a simple example of creating a linked list and adding nodes:
struct Node* head = NULL;  // Initialize an empty list

// Function to add a new node at the beginning of the list
void insertAtBeginning(int data) {
    struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));  // Allocate memory for the new node
    newNode->data = data;  // Set the data for the new node
    newNode->next = head;  // Set the next pointer of the new node to the current head
    head = newNode;  // Update the head to point to the new node
}

// Usage example
insertAtBeginning(10);  // Add a node with data 10 at the beginning
insertAtBeginning(20);  // Add a node with data 20 at the beginning
You can traverse the linked list by following the next pointers of each node until you reach the end of the list, which is indicated by a NULL pointer. This allows you to perform operations such as searching for a specific element, deleting nodes, or displaying the contents of the list.

Linked lists provide flexibility in adding and removing elements compared to arrays, but accessing elements by index is less efficient since you need to traverse the list from the beginning. However, linked lists are efficient for insertion and deletion operations at the beginning or end of the list.

Remember to properly deallocate the memory allocated for the nodes using the free function when you're done with the linked list to avoid memory leaks.
