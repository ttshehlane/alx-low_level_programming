C Linked List
A linked list is a common data structure used in computer programming, particularly in C. It is a dynamic data structure that allows efficient insertion and deletion of elements. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory allocation.

Features
Dynamic Size: Linked lists can grow or shrink dynamically based on the number of elements, unlike arrays which have a fixed size.
Efficient Insertion and Deletion: Inserting or deleting elements from a linked list is efficient, especially at the beginning or middle, as it involves changing a few pointers rather than shifting elements.
Flexibility: Linked lists can store elements of different types and can be easily adapted to various use cases.
Memory Efficiency: Linked lists only allocate memory for the elements they contain, making them memory-efficient when the size of the list is unpredictable.

Structure
In a singly linked list, each element, called a "node," consists of two parts: a data field to store the value and a link field to point to the next node in the list. The last node points to NULL, indicating the end of the list. Here's an example structure for a singly linked list node in C:

struct Node {
    int data;           // Data stored in the node
    struct Node* next;  // Pointer to the next node
};

Basic Operations
Common operations performed on a linked list include:

Insertion: Adding a new node to the list at the beginning, end, or a specific position.
Deletion: Removing a node from the list.
Traversal: Visiting each node in the list to perform some operation or display the data.
Searching: Finding a specific element in the list.
Updating: Modifying the data in a node.
Advantages and Disadvantages
Advantages of linked lists include their dynamic size, efficient insertion/deletion, and flexibility. However, they also have some drawbacks:

Random Access: Linked lists do not support direct access to elements by index, requiring traversal from the beginning of the list to reach a specific node.
Additional Memory Overhead: Linked lists require additional memory to store the link field, increasing the overall memory consumption compared to arrays.
Sequential Access: Sequentially traversing a linked list can be slower than accessing elements directly in an array due to the lack of contiguous memory.
Conclusion
C linked lists are a fundamental data structure that offers dynamic size, efficient insertion/deletion, and flexibility. They are widely used in various applications and provide an alternative to arrays when the size of the data is unknown or changes frequently.
